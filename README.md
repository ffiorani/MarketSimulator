# Market Simulator

## Overview
This project simulates a market environment composed of a single asset modeled by a limit order book and various market players. Each player starts with an equal amount of total wealth and trades in the market according to a set of rules. These rules are influenced by their randomly generated preferences and an independent news generator, all aimed at maximizing their wealth. The asset price updates based on demand trends generated by these interactions.

## Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to identify simple trading rules that market players can follow to reproduce statistical properties observed in real markets, such as:
- The Pareto distribution of returns
- Asymptotic wealth distribution

Classical mathematical models often fail to replicate these properties. Additionally, I am interested in understanding which preferences could lead to market crashes or price blowups. The ultimate hope is that these simple rules could offer significant insights into how actual market players influence the market.

## Inspirations
This project draws inspiration from several key sources:
- **The (Mis)Behaviour of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin and Reward by Benoit Mandelbrot**: In this work, Mandelbrot recovered market properties using a deterministic model based on fractals. [Link to the book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mis-Behaviour-Markets-Fractal-Reward/dp/1846682622)
- **Network Theory**: Specifically, the result that real network edge distributions can be recovered if edges are more likely to form between nodes with many existing connections. This concept parallels how social networks evolve and might provide insights into market dynamics.

## Simulation Details
- **Trading Mechanism**: Market players trade once per discrete time step based on information from the previous time step. The limit order book matches orders using a FIFO (First In, First Out) policy. Trading times, determining matching priority, are influenced by players' willingness to trade and their randomly assigned market network speed.
- **Running the Simulation**: 
  1. Install CMake.
  2. Use the provided `Makefile` commands to compile and run the simulation.
  3. The `Plotter.ipynb` Jupyter notebook visualizes the simulation results.

## Current Results
With the current settings:
- The asset price collapses immediately.
- Most player wealth is held in cash.
- The final wealth distribution follows an exponential decay.

## Customization
To modify the simulation parameters:
- **Number of Traders or Steps**: Edit the main function in `/app/main.cc`.
- **Market Player Behavior**: Adjust constants in the `MarketPlayer::computeProbabilityOfTrading` function located in `/src/Market/MarketPlayer`.

## Documentation
You can generate HTML documentation for all implemented functions using commands in the `Makefile`.
