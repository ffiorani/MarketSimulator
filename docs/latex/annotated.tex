Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classcustom__priority__queue}{custom\+\_\+priority\+\_\+queue$<$ T, S $>$}} \\*A priority queue that inherits from the STL priority\+\_\+queue It allows to remove elements from the queue It also allows to update the prices of the orders by a certain factor by iterating over the underlying container }{\pageref{classcustom__priority__queue}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_limit_order_book}{Limit\+Order\+Book}} \\*Class that models a limit order book. It has containers for ask prices, bid prices and rules for matching orders }{\pageref{class_limit_order_book}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_market}{Market}} }{\pageref{class_market}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_market_player}{Market\+Player}} \\*Class modelling traders in the market. Each trader has a unique id, a portfolio, a total wealth, a connection speed and a news responsiveness. The trader can place orders in the market, and their portfolio is updated when their orders are matched. The trader can also delete their active orders. The trader follows a set of rules to determine what orders to place, based on the information available in the \doxylink{class_limit_order_book}{Limit\+Order\+Book} and the news }{\pageref{class_market_player}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_news_generator}{News\+Generator}} }{\pageref{struct_news_generator}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_order}{Order}} \\*The \doxylink{struct_order}{Order} struct is used to represent the orders in the \doxylink{class_limit_order_book}{Limit\+Order\+Book}. It contains the price, volume, whether it is a buy or sell order, whether it is a limit or market order. It also contains a weak pointer to the trader who placed the order }{\pageref{struct_order}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_portfolio}{Portfolio}} \\*Struct that contains the portfolio of a \doxylink{class_market_player}{Market\+Player}. It included the amount of cash the trader possesses, as well as the amount of stock they own }{\pageref{struct_portfolio}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_ptr_greater}{Ptr\+Greater$<$ T $>$}} \\*Struct that allows to apply STL methods to containers of strings used in particular by the \doxylink{classcustom__priority__queue}{custom\+\_\+priority\+\_\+queue} struct and the Limit\+Order\+Book\+::active\+Orders vectors }{\pageref{struct_ptr_greater}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_ptr_less}{Ptr\+Less$<$ T $>$}} \\*Struct that allows to apply STL methods to containers of strings used in particular by the \doxylink{classcustom__priority__queue}{custom\+\_\+priority\+\_\+queue} struct and the Limit\+Order\+Book\+::active\+Orders vectors }{\pageref{struct_ptr_less}}{}
