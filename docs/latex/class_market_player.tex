\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Class modelling traders in the market. Each trader has a unique id, a portfolio, a total wealth, a connection speed and a news responsiveness. The trader can place orders in the market, and their portfolio is updated when their orders are matched. The trader can also delete their active orders. The trader follows a set of rules to determine what orders to place, based on the information available in the \doxylink{class_limit_order_book}{Limit\+Order\+Book} and the news. 

Traders will avoid bankruptcy by not placing orders that would make them go bankrupt at the time. However, as the price changes and because market orders are placed, traders can go bankrupt. For now, the market will not stop when a trader goes bankrupt, but the trader will not be able to place any more orders. The orders they have currently on the market that they cannot match will only disappear when 1) they are partially matched by some other order being placed 2) the trader decides to delete them in order to place a new order 3) the trader wants the portfolio\+If\+Orders\+Matched, which determines whether they can trade or not, to be updated.

A possible reason for bankruptcy other than price change is the fact that currently \doxylink{class_market}{Market} orders will be matched at at market price rather than the trader\textquotesingle{}s estimation, which is currently done in the same way as Limit orders.

Takes the @trader\+Ptr as input, who decides what order they want to place based on the information available in the @\+Limit\+Order\+Book and the @news. Also checks whether the order would bankrupt the trader, and if so, returns a nullptr. Otherwise, returns the order they want to place. 

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
returns a shared pointer to the order they want to place or nullptr if they would go bankrupt or if the order is not valid.
\end{DoxyReturn}
